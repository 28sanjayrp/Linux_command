If we need to track our project folders we need to initialize it to do so use -# git init command to initialize git inside perticular directory.

initialization is specific to folder to track each folder we need to track each folder by using git init command in every folder.

to know what all files or records are there in staging area - use command - #git status

#git add <filename> command is used to move filefrom working directiory to staging area.

#git commit - used to commit changes and it moves file from staging area to git directory or local repo.
