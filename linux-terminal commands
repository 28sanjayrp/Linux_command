the project1 directory will copy inside project2 directory, which means project2/project1/ here it has all the files.
17)$rm <file_name>               #to remove or delete regular file
18)$rm -rf <directory name>      # to delete directory, If you want to delete an empty directory, you can use the recursive (-r) flag only, 
 #On the other hand, to remove a directory with content inside of it, you need to use the force (-f) and recursive flags
 for example : $rm -r project1  #for empty directory
               $rm -f project2  #for directory with content(s).
19)$mv <source_file> <destination_folder/>              #You use the $mv command to move (or rename) files and directories through your file system.
  example - $mv project1/file1.txt project2/
  
  note: ./ is the directory youâ€™re currently in.
 
 20)#man <any_command> - examle:$man mkdir           #It displays the manual page of any other command (as long as it has one).
   $man man                   #You could even refer to the man manual page.($man man)
 note: press h for help and q for quit. man is system manual pager.
 
21)$chmod          #The chmod command lets you change the mode of a file (permissions) quickly. It has a lot of options available with it.

The basic permissions a file can have are:

r (read)
w (write)
x (execute)
 
 One of the most common use cases for chmod is to make a file executable by the user. To do this,
 type chmod and the flag +x, followed by the file you want to modify permissions on: $chmod +x file1.txt
